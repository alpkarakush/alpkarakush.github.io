I like [Urban Dictiony](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) for it's raw content and it helped me a lot to learn street jargons and intricacies of english. The same didn't exist for my native language. The idea to create one brewed for a long time and finally I finished most of it in Fedruary of 2024.

It was the first time using Flask and I gotta say that I'm impressed by it's simplicity.
