I am a senior student at Faculty of Information Technology in [Czech Technical University](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).

My interests include:

- Music ([Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/bekbolot-kudayberdiev))
- Reading ([GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79576550-bekbolot-khudaiberdiev))
- Programming ([Github](https://github.com/alpkarakush))

I sometimes like to organize information on the internet and write book reviews. I wish I knew more math.
